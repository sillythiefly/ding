# ding
ding is a little script I made to get a noise after a command that i know will take some time (sounds not included... yet)

recomended usage "somecommand && ding"

syntax: ding [-c|h|v]


          make it ding
    c     remake config, change sound, will autorun if no config detected
    h     print this
    v     print software version and exit


# install
just plop it in /usr/bin/
